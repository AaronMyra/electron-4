# React

Building an Interface

> > Author Notes:

React is a revolutionary framework that introduced some important concepts that have quickly helped it dominate the world of Front End Developers. Hey there, I'm Ray Villalobos and in this course, I'm going to show you the basics of working with React by creating an interface that's solves a common web development task, managing appointments for a company...in our case making appointments for a Pet Doctor.

In order to take care of that, we'll create a form that lets people add appointments, read a list of the appointments from a file and also delete, modify, search and sort those appointments.

This course is meant to be a practical hands-on guide that shows you how React works using plain language. It's different than other courses because building something realistic shows you how things are connected and how to solve real problems with React. I hope you take the time to work through the problems with me as I go through the course.

This course is also part of a series of courses where I've built a similar application in different languages like jQuery, Angular and Vue.js...That means that going through these course can help you look at the advantage one framework has over the others.

So if that sounds like something you'd want to try out, then it's time to get started.
