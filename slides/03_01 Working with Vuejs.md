# Working with Vue.js

We've learned how to work with a regular HTML project and most of the things you need to build an application. However certain frameworks really work well with Electron, especially those that are good at creating interfaces like React and Vue.js.

Let's get started by installing a project with the Vue CLI.

## npm install

```
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
$ vue create electron-4
$ vue add electron-builder
```
